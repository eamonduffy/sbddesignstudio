# SpringBoot-React-Template

This repository contains a template project for building a web application using Spring Boot (Java) for the backend and React.js for the frontend. The project is organized into separate directories for the backend and frontend components.

## Backend

The backend directory contains the server-side code written in Spring Boot. It follows a GraphQL architecture for handling API requests. Here's an overview of the files and directories within the backend:

-   `src/main/java/com/duffy/backend`: The Java source code for the backend.
    -   `controllers`: Contains the controller classes that define the GraphQL endpoints.
    -   `models`: Contains the data models used in the application, including the `Tutorial` and `Author` classes.
    -   `repositories`: Contains the repository interfaces for data access.
    -   `services`: Contains the service classes that handle the business logic and data operations.
-   `src/main/resources`: Contains the application configuration files and resources.
    -   `application.properties`: Configures various settings for the Spring Boot application, such as database connection details.

## Frontend

The frontend directory contains the client-side code written in React.js. It handles the user interface and communicates with the backend API. Here's an overview of the files and directories within the frontend:

-   `src/components`: Contains the reusable React components used in the application.
-   `src/pages`: Contains the main pages of the application, such as the tutorial listing and tutorial details pages.
-   `src/graphql`: Contains the client-side GraphQL querires responsible for making requests to the backend.
-   `src/App.js`: The main entry point for the React application.
-   `src/index.js`: Renders the root component and sets up the React application.

## Getting Started

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Java, Maven, and Node.js installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/eamonduffy/SpringBoot-React-Template.git`
3. Navigate to the backend directory: `cd SpringBoot-React-Template/backend`
4. Build and run the Spring Boot backend: `mvn spring-boot:run`
5. Open another terminal and navigate to the frontend directory: `cd ../frontend`
6. Install the frontend dependencies: `npm install`
7. Start the frontend development server: `npm start`
8. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the application.

Feel free to explore and modify the code in both the backend and frontend directories to fit your specific requirements.
